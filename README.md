# Rapido-Bike-sharing
 Given the Data in which we have the ride details such as Time-stamp, Number(Is it customer number?) , Pick up and rop latitude and longitude need to build a model which would predict the ride request for future. (This whole HTML is written in Jupyter notebook)  My approach will be doing EDA and building clusters on the basis of Positioning. Including Holidays Inclusing Weather(as long as i dont know the city i will be unable to include them) Prediction on the basis of clusters(probably i will not include cluster validation part) for the Ride requests I will mostly focus on more and more feature engineering and i believe in Finding the best Error Matrix(This worked out as a charm in most of the cases!).
